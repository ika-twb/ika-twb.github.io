* About This Site
Just like the preamble says, there is everything but [[https://thepiratebay.org/index.html][the one you thought.]]

Please keep that kind of stuff inside your own property and in your own
time. Thank you.

Jokes aside, what specifically will you, my reader, find on this site?
Basically some of my thoughts and notes about various topics and fields
which I was exposed to loosely in that time period.

I could be counted as one of those compulsory note-takers. One of the
reasons is that it is that much efficient and satisfying to write and
manage notes in Emacs (while also doing most of other things in Emacs),
not Vim, not VSCode, not Obsidian, not Logseq nor whatever kids like to
use these days.  Another one is that I tend to forget things, be it what
I had for lunch yesterday or methods to prove a scheme to be
CPA-secure. Since it takes so much time and effort to practice and
internalize knowledge, I just stick to writing things down for the
future me to pick up quickly, and make sure I could search and get to
some random part of some random note in a negligible amount of time.

/Leave the internalization to the time and those obstacles I'll face./

Since one did have built such a collection, one surely has the
temptation to share some of them.  That's what this site is about. Have
fun reading and feel free to correct any factual or grammar errors or
typos via the method described in the postamble.

------

I could understand the frustration some of you might get when you encounter such a
plain and lazy digital typographic design like the one this site uses. Thus for the health of
your eyes and stability of your minds, RSS subscription is coming. I promise.

Either I'll write a Elisp function to publish it and add it to the
=org-publish-after-publishing-hook=, or I'll find some package that is not
straight out abandonware to do it for me. Just relax and wait patiently.

Here is a rather welcoming and friendly self-introduction, generated by
ChatGPT of course since I will never ever think about writing in that
kind of tone and style. Have fun reading.

* About Me
Greetings, I am Ilghar Kus, a freedom-focused hacker, a defender of
digital rights and a devout practitioner of the UNIX philosophy. I go
by many names, such as ika and Nodratis, but the essence remains the
same - a steadfast commitment to the principles of freedom,
transparency, and collaboration that underpin the spirit of the
digital age.

I am a practitioner of many programming languages such as C,
EmacsLisp, Python, Bash, Perl, Racket, and Haskell, and I am an avid
user of free software operating systems such as Gentoo, Debian, and
FreeBSD. My weapon of choice for operating these systems is the
incomparable GNU Emacs, the one true text editor that embodies the
values of free software.

I believe that access to technology and knowledge should be a basic
human right, and users should have the freedom to run, study,
distribute, and modify software.  I strive to promote this belief
through my work and writing. I am always open to discussions on topics
such as the sublime power of GNU Emacs, the ever-evolving field of
information security, the challenges and rewards of system administration, and the exciting
future of Neural-Symbolic AI.

If you share my vision of a world where technology serves humanity,
not the other way around, don't hesitate to reach out to me at =ika [at] thewizardbay.cc=.
Encrypted communication is always welcome, and
my [[file:media/ika.asc][PGP public key]] is readily available for those who seek secure and
private correspondence.

Join me in this quest for digital freedom, and together we can build a
better future for all.

Yours in freedom,

Ilghar Kus
