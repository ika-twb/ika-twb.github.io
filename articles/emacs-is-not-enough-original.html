<p>

</p>

<p>
The Emacs reputation has been that
of a strange piece of software that grants you powers if you were to
just take them.
</p>

<p>
The crowd that gets attracted to it are the kind of users who find
inefficiencies of interaction with the machine to be supremely
annoying. That leads to much tinkering and workflow optimization.
Everyone in that crowd is a power user.
</p>

<p>
And what do you know, a certain level of comfort may, indeed, be
reached if you invest yourself into the customization process.
And I think anybody who cares about what they do is a power user at
heart.
</p>

<p>
 <figure class=figRight> <img class=imgFigRight
src=./img/brick.jpg /> <figcaption class=captionRight> <i>Douglas
Engelbart's precursor to the mouse. This one was simply used to
convince people that tools matter.</i> 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, most of
us have learned to cope too well with all the shitty tools we
have. And, in the current culture, the cult of <i>just getting the job
done</i> is too prevalent to overcome that. The fear to take a dive for a
long-term benefit overcomes any desire to be comfortable.
</p>

<p>
And then there are the floaters, the passers-by. They judge Emacs
solely by its features.
</p>

<p>
But that's not how a power users judges it.  Instead, the power user
judges a piece of software by what power it provides and what he could
do with that power to help himself.
</p>

<p>
So, really, the target audience of Emacs are power users, who often
times end up being contributors to the ecosystem in one way or
another.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has gained a cult-status of sorts.  The landscape of programs
that have positioned themselves quite the way Emacs does is quite
empty. And that's probably why it has gained that status.
</p>

<p>
Some are convinced it's immortal and can never be replaced.
</p>

<p>
But it must be said that it's not Emacs that is somehow too good to be
surviving for so long. It's just that everything else is so bad.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
But let's start waaaay back.
</p>

<p>
What do you remember as a kid, playing in a sandbox? A sand-pile in
your backyard, with some other kids?  (I bet there were other kids
there, you weren't a lonely weirdo playing in all that sand by
yourself, were you?)
</p>

<p>
What I remember is that a sand-pile by itself is never enough.  You
need some water. Some larger rocks. Some sticks. Some grass, perhaps.
And a bit of crude imagination to construct a stick figure or a car or
something.  But I digress.
</p>

<p>
Get a load of this:
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry A. Davis of TempleOS draws sprites directly into his fucking terminal.</b>
</p>

<p>
Look at this shit. LOOK!
</p>

<p>
Context (dc) <a
href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eK4QRH22Uk><img class=imgCenter
src=./img/templeos-graphics.png />
</p>

<p>
<i>It may even be 3D.</i>
</p>

<p>
That sprite is then embedded into the source code and may be
referenced as a pointer.
</p>

<p>
In his terminal,
</p>

<p>
In his OS,
</p>

<p>
Using his own compiler of Holy C (with his ACTUALLY useful
improvements over C. That, for your interest, takes <i>Divine
Intellect.</i>),
</p>

<p>
All running on a resolution of 640x480.
</p>

<p>
Why 640x480?
</p>

<p>
<b>Cause God said so.</b>
</p>

<p>
That man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXn4njGgfkE">communicates with God</a> through a random number generator.
</p>

<p>
Terry is the High Priest.
</p>

<p>
And he loves himself some simplicity.
</p>

<p>
And listen, Terry may seem a little bit arrogant to you, but he
actually is <i>the smartest programmer that ever lived</i>.
</p>

<p>
In short, Terry is a decent person. Or was. Till those glowy CIA
schmucks finally got him with a GODDAMNED TRAIN. And I would like to
think, it would have taken NOTHING less than a BIG ASS SPEEDING TRAIN
to do Terry in.
</p>

<p>
Rest in piece, Terry Davis, a true preacher of God's Word.
</p>

<p>
Eh. Anyhow.
</p>

<p>
<i>(Yes, this article is still about Emacs, keep reading, anon.)</i>
</p>

<p>
Terry preached that you should entertain God.
</p>

<p>
Go rob a bank. Go write <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQEfLaR4Pg">an advanced flight simulator</a>.  Or produce a soap opera (god loves those).
</p>

<p>
I think that Terry viscerally understood that this god entertainment
business would be an awful lot easier to be doing with graphics, and
that's why it was so <i>integrated</i> in TempleOS.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://emacssurvey.org/">Emacs Survey</a> is a funny thing: they ask you to fill it out <i>in a web browser</i>, then they <a href="https://emacs-survey.netlify.app/2020/">provide the results</a> that
you can only view <i>in a web browser</i>, and offer you to download CSV
data to view it <i>in a spreadsheet application</i>.
</p>

<p>
Or, well, of course, you could <i>just</i> fill it out in w3m/lynx and then
<i>be having fun</i> reading it in <i>fundamental mode</i>. Then you could stamp
out <b>AWESOME</b> on your forehead and wear a pair of horns. You
could. You certainly could.
</p>

<p>
<i>But you won't.</i>
</p>

<p>
Well, I mean, I spent 15 minutes typing out my written responses, and
they just put a comma-separated file (CSV) out there?  How the hell do
I even read a CSV file?  Do I have to install R or something?
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice is messing up my rows.
</p>

<p>
But I want a <i>premade interface</i> for it, and I am confused as to why
the authors haven't provided it for me.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Maybe because they don't care about the actual answers there, huh?
Were the written responses just an exercise?
</p>

<p>
Or, wait a second, why don't I go and <i>just read that CSV in Emacs</i>?
Somehow, it wasn't the first thought that came to my mind, you see.
</p>

<p>
But CSV <i>is</i> text, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Well, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/?q=csv">lemme check</a> real quick, because
the everpotent Emacs must have a package for working with CSV files.
</p>

<p>
OK. I see some parsers. Good. Some import library.  Nice. <i>NICE</i>. And
an exporter to org-mode clock.
</p>

<p>
Well, OK, but how tf do I read this shit?
</p>

<p>
It looks like spaghetti when I look at it in fundamental mode.  And I
get the feeling that my eyes are working a bit faster than Emacs can
scroll.
</p>

<p>
Well, alright, I don't see no <i>CSV-mode</i> to arrange everything into a
pretty table and then let me filter/sort/edit the damn thing.
</p>

<p>
<i>But am I really asking for much?</i>
</p>

<p>
Well, no. Thing is, you just can't do that in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Did you hear that?
</p>

<p>
A table editor within emacs will be janky, it will be a slow heap of
cowdung, outspreading and dispersing, channeling the fumes.
</p>

<p>
And guess what, even <b>displaying</b> a structure like that would be a
pain in the ass.
</p>

<p>
And forget about editing it. (Think multi-line boxes for long text
fields.)
</p>

<p>
Yea, well, <i>technically</i>, it's doable. Alright. Org-mode has tables.
You can even autoformat them after each edit.
</p>

<p>
<i>But you don't want that thing to get that much larger than your
literal thumbnail.</i>
</p>

<p>
And not that others haven't tried to do better. Take a look at this
presentation: <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/talks/18/">Object oriented spreadsheets with example applications</a>. Yeah, it's a pretty table
alright. But the key quote there for the purposes of our discussion
is:
</p>

<p>
<i>It does need to be optimized. It can be a little bit sluggish.</i>
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, <i>it can be</i>.
</p>

<p>
FACT: <i>You can't have a usable table in Emacs. Even if its <b>all
text</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
Yeah, OK, anon, you don't care about tables. I do, but you
don't. Fine.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you care about Lisp. Maybe you even do some Common Lisp
development from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Well, I do Lisp programming in Emacs. Just about everyone does.
</p>

<p>
One of the projects I am using is April. It's an APL compiler, and
lets you work on arrays.
</p>

<p>
So, I have macroexpanded April's internal
<code>vex</code> form, and the macroexpansion was 1.3MB at ~26000 lines of code.
It's not important why that macroexpansion had to be that big. It
simply was.
</p>

<p>
And I wanted to see that expansion.
</p>

<p>
Well, scrolling that thing was not fun, I will tell you that.  Neither
was getting spammed with:
</p>

<p>
<code>Parenthesis max limit reached.</code>
And then with:
</p>

<p>
<code>Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1207370) signaled

</p>

<p>
Along with:
</p>

<p>
<code>Timed out waiting for property-notify event [5 times]</code>
</p>

<p>
and this:
</p>

<p>
<code>eldoc error: (error Lisp nesting exceeds max-lisp-eval-depth)</code>
</p>

<p>
What is all this?
</p>

<p>
This is not <i>smooth</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is not <i>snappy</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is not <i>cool</i>.
</p>

<p>
Which all begs the question.
</p>

<p>
Everybody talks about how great Emacs is at Common Lisp.  When I
started using it, the greatest part was Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Here's the deal: Emacs is shit at Common Lisp. Slime or Sly, it
doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
OK, forget about the 1.3MB macroexpansion.
</p>

<p>
How about you go and rename all occurrences of a symbol in all files
in your project? Well, guess what, that, too, is a pain in the ass.
Even the built-in renaming facility bugs out on me for some reason (I
don't remember it's name, because I don't even try to use it anymore).
</p>

<p>
And how about importing the current qualified symbol at point into the
<code>defpackage</code> definition?
</p>

<p>
<i>No. Too hard.</i>
</p>

<p>
I also like my s-expressions to vary in color based on the nesting
levels. I use <code>rainbow-blocks</code> for that, and it works fairly well.
</p>

<p>
Except, of course, when it suddenly stops working occasionally (for
some reason unbeknownst to me) and the fontification gets all fucked.
</p>

<p>
<i>Even if the parentheses are all balanced.</i>
</p>

<p>
Where did this myth come from, the idea that Emacs is some super duper
shit for Lisp?  This shit is shit!
</p>

<p>
And yeah, I am not reporting any
of it.  The fixes are going to be cardboard patches on the hull of a
sinking ship anyway.  If you look closely, <i>the whole ship</i> is mess of
cardboard boxes, glue and styrofoam.
</p>

<p>
And, hey, by the way, what's that <code>comint</code> crap? Because, anon, using
a REPL prompt is a real trip.
</p>

<p>
Why is input not separate from the output?  Srsly, why the fuck are
they in the same buffer?
</p>

<p>
My <code>evil-mode</code> cursor behavior around that prompt is fucking
ridiculous.  (And, I fear, not just because <code>evil-mode</code> is a buggy
pile of crap.)
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you: I shouldn't end up on that <code>CL-USER&gt;</code> prompt with my
cursor, <i>not like fucking ever</i>.  The output should be placed
separately, ffs. The input place is simply not where the output should
go in a read-eval-print-loop application.
</p>

<p>
Why are they merged into the same place? Well, there's simply no other
way of doing it, that's why.  Managing window positioning is simply
too painful.
</p>

<p>
So&#x2026; what happened here? Do you know?
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you what happened: <i>Emacs being decrepit</i> is what
happened.
</p>

<p>
Look at <code>CIDER</code>. It's many years old. I install it and what do I see?
The REPL buffer is read-only half of the time.
</p>

<p>
<i>And only some of the print statement output is printed in there.</i>
</p>

<p>
I have no clue why.
</p>

<p>
Is this not a mess? Yes. A goddamn fucking mess.
</p>

<p>
Or, perhaps, ask yourself why you can't do stuff like <i>multinarrowing</i>
(narrowing of multiple parts of a file).
</p>

<p>
Or why you don't have <i>transclusion</i> (having the same piece of data in
various places at once).
</p>

<p>
Or why Emacs can't do code indentation on proportional fonts.
</p>

<p>
And, listen&#x2026; when you are coding a function in Elisp, you are
basically moving your pointer all over the buffer to do <i>anything at
all</i>.
</p>

<p>
Why are you doing that?
</p>

<p>
That's <i>imperative</i>.
</p>

<p>
More so, the fact of having to move the cursor/point all over the
place is <i>worse</i> than just being <i>imperative</i>.  Much worse. Ever heard
of LOGO?
</p>

<p>
Well, Elisp might as well be considered the LOGO of the Lisp world,
and Emacs is its turtle of text editing.
</p>

<p>
<img class=imgSmall src=./img/turtle.jpg />
</p>

<p>
<i>Emacs: turtle programming for textual matrices</i>.
</p>

<p>
<img class=imgSmall src=./img/turtle.gif />
</p>

<p>
And, so: anything. Anything. Takes. Fucking. <i>Forever.</i> To accomplish.
</p>

<p>
But there's more, anon. There's a lot more behind all this.
</p>

<p>
Say, why is Elisp completion always so fucking slow?
</p>

<p>
Why is every language mode so janky as fuck?
</p>

<p>
<i>WHY IS EVERYTHING SO JANKY AF?</i>
</p>

<p>
And, hey, let me <i>not</i> tell you about all the things that are wrong
with <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>. Indentation gets routinely
screwed. Try making a footnote with a link in it, find out how much
jolly good fun that is. Tags don't allow dashes or spaces. Tables
suck. Exporting is non-transparent. Working with code blocks
(<i>org-babel</i>) is just as pure as pain as you can have in front of a
computer screen these days. I could go on and on. It's not worth
listing everything.
</p>

<p>
Or, yeah, try truncating lines on the text-only paragraphs, but not on
the code blocks.  Can't do it, can you?
</p>

<p>
And I can't tell you how fucking tiring it is to be using links.  They
aren't even autoupdating.  Any link to a heading will <i>expire</i> as soon
as you modify any path to that link.  So, I have to be doing custom
identifiers <i>by hand</i>.
</p>

<p>
And then, every time I hit
<code>insert-heading-dwim</code> in a moderately large file (not even that large
at just 172kb), I have to wait for a full second before the heading
appears in the tree. When you edit a list of items, checking an item
at point will rescan the whole tree, because, hey, you gotta <i>rescan
and recalculate all that stuff, right?</i>
</p>

<p>
Anon, look, none of this would need to be so bad if the buffer were
<b>structured</b>.
</p>

<p>
&gt; STRUCTURE is a an important word here. It will come up time and time
  again if you keep reading.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is an editor of textual data, isn't it? (Yeah, the kind where,
hopefully, the lines aren't too long.)
</p>

<p>
The data structure that Emacs uses is called a <i>gap buffer</i>.
</p>

<p>
A gap buffer.
</p>

<p>
<i>You can't really impose structure on it beyond that.</i>
</p>

<p>
That's it. That's the end of the line. <i>A gap buffer.</i>
</p>

<p>
There are no good mechanisms for imposing structure, except overlays
or markers or regexps.  And neither is my idea of a good
mechanism. All of it is just duct tape and WD-40.
</p>

<p>
Overlays in emacs track the positions of a piece of string.  They work
about as well as throwing mud at the wall and hoping it will stick,
like trying to solder a copper wire to an aluminum contact, hoping
everything will just stay put and not get loose later on. A quite
expensive ugliness which has a very tangible impact on performance.
</p>

<p>
This is why JSON files were slow until <i>core</i> had to be hacked to
throw in some optimizations.  Why did it have to be slow in the first
place? Well: because highlighting with a regexp is a fucking bad idea.
</p>

<p>
And, yeah, many people have accomplished plenty of mundane things with
just duct tape and a can of WD.  Some are even proud of their redneck
artistry.
</p>

<p>
But it's not how you really build stuff.
</p>

<p>
See, things like <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a> (it
lets you query an Org-mode buffer) <b>shouldn't have to exist</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>What you want is to <i>start with the structure</i> and then simply
<i>expose it to the extension author</i>. And it's not just about the
extensions: <i>just about every user function requires some structural
knowledge</i>.</b>
</p>

<p>
And in a file where formal structure is expected for
correct functioning, <b>it doesn't make sense <i>not</i> to enforce it at all
times</b>.  For a second, just think about what kind of <i>shit</i> you have
to go through to get anything working in a <b>structureless</b> document.
Hmm, let's see: the obvious one is <i>parsing</i>.  And well, when
something goes awry, and it will, throw in more parsing, but now with
some <i>ad-hoc error handling</i>.  And then add <i>caching</i>, because, <i>hey,
shit, this thing is working kinda slow, huh?</i> Get back to more error
handling and more parsing and <i>reparsing</i>, because that thing
is&#x2026; broken <i>again</i>? Maybe <i>optimize</i> your compiler while you are it.
Wait, what, <i>caching</i> wasn't enough?  <i>Everything</i> is still slow and
works like crap?  Is it time for some <i>truly clever</i> optimizations and
techniques?  Time to <i>really-really</i> roll those sleeves up?
</p>

<p>
Ohhh, but, my friend, here your funny trip across the unstructureland
hits something called <b>GRADE-A HEAVY METAL DUTY ASS OF REALITY</b>.  Like
a flowery, pink-flavored air bubble, your dream shatters against that
cast iron surface and with it go your any hopes of making anything
work fast EVER AGAIN. And forget <i>fast</i>: <i><b>well</b></i>. Nothing will ever
again work <i><b>well</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
You have a realization:
</p>

<p>
<i>The only way to truly subdue all the mess is to <b>enforce
structure</b>. This is the only way to make it right.</i>
</p>

<p>
And by <i>structure</i> I mean a <i>data structure</i> which you can interface
directly, with no extra copies in the middle.  Then your optimization
goals are on a much higher level from the start, and, in fact, you
probably won't even have to think about the performance anyway.
</p>

<p>
Forget all that jackjob mud-hut garbage programming bullshit: no one
has deserved THAT.
</p>

<p>
Do you want to be robust and beautiful, as opposed to being half-assed
and ugly?  Choose specialized structure, not a gap buffer.  And Emacs
is gap buffers all the way through.
</p>

<p>
And so, everything is a <i>string</i> in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Structural enforcement and everything that relies on the knowledge of
structural information is simply too hard when your representation of
data is a string.
</p>

<p>
Of course, enforcing structure in a buffer is not <i>technically</i>
impossible. It's just too hard for the practical purposes for anyone
to try or do meaningfully.
</p>

<p>
Look, anon, the fact that most data we work with is structural is the
reason why there are <i>major modes</i> in Emacs.  The sole purpose of
major modes is to deal with some particular <i>structure</i> of the
document at hand.
</p>

<p>
Any major mode you can think of does that, except <code>fundamental-mode</code>,
which simply says we don't know what the document even <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
If you are building a text editor and find yourself asking a question
like:
</p>

<p>
<i>What's better: a gap buffer or a piece tree or a rope?</i>
</p>

<p>
Then the correct answer is, of course:
</p>

<p>
<i>Neither, most of the time</i>.
</p>

<p>
Some people make it sound like it has to be a choice.
</p>

<p>
<i>It doesn't.</i>
</p>

<p>
You have to make that decision based on the data you want to edit. You
don't have to be locked into one single representation of everything,
which, for some reason, is the running assumption for every text
editor in existence.
</p>

<p>
<i>That representation is a: <b>string</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
Why don't we have specialized editors instead?
</p>

<p>
I don't know, but certainly not because it's too hard. Making a decent
specialized editor based on the fitting data structures is naturally
easier than specializing a general editor to a specific task (not with
the existing architectures anyhow).
</p>

<p>
A universal data structure is often assumed to be good for building a
common interface to every kind of text file.  But <b>nothing</b> prevents
specialized editors from having a common interface like
that. <b>Nothing.</b>
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Look: <b>Emacs is just bad at textual interfaces.</b>
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that's what people assume it's for, and therefore it must be
good at it, but it isn't.
</p>

<p>
There are no specialization mechanisms. Only the buffer, which is just
a string.  You can't do complex things on a string and get very far.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of structure breeds half-assed solutions.</i>
</p>

<p>
On top of that, Emacs promotes an imperative style of
programming. Turtle turtle turtle.
</p>

<p>
And no, there isn't some higher-level API interface to be had
there. It's <i>also</i> too hard.
</p>

<p>
No wonder it takes forever to get anything done.  I have 200+ <i>todo</i>
wishlist items for my Emacs config.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>  A lot of people probably have more.
</p>

<p>
Most of these items are trivial to imagine.
</p>

<p>
But they are <i>not</i> trivial to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, your ass is a bit on fire, ain't it? What are you so riled up about?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nothing, friend, nothing. Or maybe just the fact that Emacs sucks
giant balls.  Emacs is much like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTf3INXJMFY">Uncle Gubsy</a> from your childhood.ee
</p>

<p>
Not even that I care so much.  Sure, I have spent hours, days, weeks
on its configuration.
</p>

<p>
Oh, hell, who am I lying to? Not to the legion, that's for sure. But
to myself maybe?
</p>

<p>
Months, anon. <i>Months.</i>
</p>

<p>
As many people did.
</p>

<p>
But all of that matters very little, to tell you the truth.  Because I
ain't even close to feeling any sort of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
My Emacs experience started gauche. Years passed. It's still gauche.
And my &gt;3000-line <code>.emacs</code> setup will still feel gauche even if I were
to have a body double who would babysit my config and fix anything and
everything that annoys me, which, trust me anon, is way more than the
meager 200 bullet points.
</p>

<p>
But, I assure you, continuous effort still won't fix shit, not even
one man's config.
</p>

<p>
I have stopped adding these items.
</p>

<p>
And, by the way, you ever hear about those guys who have, like, 2
lines of Elisp for their config and they are happy?  Let me tell you
something about them:
</p>

<p>
Those aren't real Emacsers.  They are just posers. Floaters.
</p>

<p>
Not constantly fucking around with your Emacs config is a
non-idiomatic way of using emacs.  Period.
</p>

<p>
We aren't going to listen to their opinion, they are jumping ship to
<i>corporate express</i> tomorrow anyway. So let's ignore that noise, OK?
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
So, where are we here, exactly?!
</p>

<p>
<i>If Emacs sucked so bad, surely someone would have fixed it by now?</i>
</p>

<p>
Oh, boy. Rewriting Emacs is possibly the most tropey of all Emacs
talk.
</p>

<p>
Common Lisp people? They always want to <i>port fucking Emacs</i> or
<i>rewrite fucking Emacs</i> or <i>copy from fucking Emacs</i> or <i>just be the
fucking Emacs in some way</i>.
</p>

<p>
Or, wait for it&#x2026;: how about <i>steal some Emacs code</i> by basically
wet-dreaming up some magic emulation layer! This idea is just as
misguided as it is widespread. It echoes across chat-rooms and it
distracts from the real problems.
</p>

<p>
And then, yeah, "porting". Well:
porting Emacs to some foreign ecosystem (such as Guile) would be even
worse.  Any kind of merging will result in a problem of <i>homogeneity</i>.
Even if it's Guile. Especially if it's Guile.
</p>

<p>
Porting or importing or merging would be no less than a man-made
disaster for the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Nobody takes these discussions seriously, of course, because everybody
understands that this kind of stuff is kind of <i>out there</i>, if not
immediately ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
And even if any of it were feasible: <i>it doesn't fucking fix
anything</i>.
</p>

<p>
You will never replace Elisp or fix Emacs if you are willing to port
it. Porting it defeats the whole point of moving to a better system,
because the systems would necessarily be incompatible. They would be
incompatible because a vastly better system is the only kind that will
actually make people move, and, so, it must be fundamentally
different, therefore &#x2013; incompatible.
</p>

<p>
Mind you, these aren't just some proposals about rewriting and
porting, there are projects that do this.  And while the efforts are
well-intended, they are futile!
</p>

<p>
<i>The problem of Emacs is not a language problem.</i>
</p>

<p>
Certainly, Elisp isn't the sharpest of lisps, but it does the job.  In
fact, it's probably the best part of Emacs.
</p>

<p>
But one major mental block among all these discussions never fails to
surface and that's: <i>packages</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>Oh how do we possibly rewrite or port Emacs and all that <b>terribly</b> useful code?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Look, anon: <i>Emacs doesn't have to be rewritten.</i>
</p>

<p>
The fact of the matter is: <i><b>we don't want another Emacs</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
We want something radically different, something that supports <i>the
structural approach</i>.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is pretty much incompatible with this idea of being structured
in any way. And so, all its 10 gazillion lines of Elisp are a
liability, not an asset.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I am saying that to have a better Lisp environment for text
editing, we need to abandon ALL of elisp and ALL of Emacs.  <i>And don't
look back.</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, but there are over 5000 packages?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, fuck that shit, anon! We don't need them.
</p>

<p>
Fuck 5000 packages. Fuck twenty and a hundred thousand packages.
</p>

<p>
None of it matters, I am telling you.
</p>

<p>
If the foundation is rotten, I don't care how many man-hours have gone
down the shitter trying to prove that foundation worthy.  At this
point it's all sunk costs and damage control.
</p>

<p>
Our end? We are just gonna be <i>inspired</i> by how <i>inconsequential</i> and
<i>bad</i> all of it is, no more.
</p>

<p>
And, by the way, remember what I told you about imperative code?
Well, here come the big fucking news: all of Elisp ever written is
kind of crap.  I don't mean to be bashing the authors of said code,
it's not their fault. But it is what it is.
</p>

<p>
We want to flush it down the drain of eternity, not keep it.
</p>

<p>
And let's look at some of these fucking packages anyway, just for the
fuck of it.
</p>

<p>
Trust me, they all look the same:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>beginend</i>: Redefine M-&lt; and M-&gt; for some modes</li>
<li><i>belarus-holidays</i>: Belarus holidays with transfers</li>
<li><i>cfrs</i>: Child-frame based read-string</li>
</ul>

<p>
I.e. some fucking gibberish.
</p>

<p>
The real interesting players are <i>Org-mode</i> and <i>magit</i>. That's it.
And since <a href="./c-programmers-wrote-git.html">Git is for bums</a> anyhow, that just leaves Org-mode.
</p>

<p>
<i>There are no large applications in Emacs. Emacs packages don't tend
to solve difficult or large problems.</i>
</p>

<p>
And at the quality of the small things present - nothing of true value
will be lost.
</p>

<p>
Everything else is pretty much stopwatches, around 15 completion
frameworks, a million half-assed language support packages, themes and
whatever <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/">alphapapa</a> felt like writing or adopting this or the other day.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dad-jokes</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Tetris</i>.
</p>

<p>
Anon, this shit is <i>lame</i>, can't you see?!
</p>

<p>
The real good stuff is not so numerous and we can just steal it, but
do it right this time over.
</p>

<p>
And we don't need to be even looking <i>at the packages</i>, we need to be
looking <i>at our experience using this software as a whole</i>.  That's
the source of real value. Not code.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>But there's like 10 gorillion lines of Elisp code?!</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes and it <i>doesn't matter</i>. The current architecture of Emacs is
simply incompatible with drastic improvements.  The platform is simply
suboptimal. The best way is to abandon everything.
</p>

<p>
And that's just for text. I haven't even mentioned anything about
stuff like vector graphics.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, why do you think a text editor needs graphics?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A rookie question, but I shall answer it, it's illuminating.
</p>

<p>
Because whoever said Emacs was a text editor, huh?  Emacs just happens
to be a platform where people can (try to) build <del>decent</del> textual
interfaces.
</p>

<p>
If it had graphics, that would have been used too.  People try to slap
graphics onto it (like with GTK widgets<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>), but none of
it is idiomatic, of course, so nobody will use it. As expected.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, if Emacs is so bad, why are you still using it?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because, dear anon, everything else is so so much more <i>shit</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, you mentioned Guile. What's the problem with extending Emacs with other languages? Isn't that powerful?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Running everything on a virtual machine that would support more than
Elisp is a <i>bad</i> idea.  Those who think it's a good idea are mistaken
about the target audience of Emacs: they forget that Emacs is
primarily for power users.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a bazaar of languages that can't interoperate well, you
lose on power.  <i>And the one thing you don't want to do is try to
snatch away power from the power user</i>.
</p>

<p>
You may load a Lua interpreter in your Lisp image, or allow extensive
FFI.  But no one is gaining any power from that, only some short-term
convenience which will obstruct the power user later on.  You just
can't start writing text functions in Lua or whatever and expect the
target audience to be happy about it.
</p>

<p>
I talk more about this in other articles and refer to this problem as
<i>homogeneity</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, can't you just hack Emacs to be better?</i>

<p>
Nope.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, aren't there structural editors already and don't they suck?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are structural editors out there. And, yes, they sucked and
that's why they disappeared into obscurity. It was so because you
couldn't use them like you could use Emacs, with the point freely
running around everywhere.
</p>

<p>
But that doesn't mean that they can't do it also or that they have to
suck. I have proposed <i>seamless</i> structural editing in <a href="./the-power-of-structure.html">the previous article</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, isn't writing specialized structural editors more difficult?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No. In fact, it's easier because you can reuse such editors within
each other. Structure is also conducive to the design of complex
interaction and interoperation behaviors.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, if there were many specialized editors, wouldn't you have to configure each one separately?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The configuration of common elements (such as bindings for common
commands) could be easily shared. All the editors would simply have to
have some <i>common interface</i> for textual manipulation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, but Emacs must have gotten something right, right?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, yessir, a few things.
</p>

<p>
Lisp. Elisp might not have turned out to be the greatest dialect in
existence. There are problems with multithreading, with namespaces,
with a few other things. But, overall, it's usable and is, certainly,
not the worst of problems that Emacs is facing right now.
</p>

<p>
What else is good? Well, extensibility. To a degree. Emacs showed what
interactive extensibility can be like and how it can serve us. I
believe it showed that there are a lot of people who can appreciate it
in personal computing.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I also bashed the notion of buffers, but the idea of
<i>everything being a buffer</i> proved to be very handy.  That means
everything has some common interface and is manipulated via the same
set of commands. (Except the modeline. It was, apparently, too
structured to implement non-structurally.)
</p>

<p>
Is there anything to add to this? Probably not.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>It there really no point in reusing all that code from Emacs and its package system?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Don't worry, anon, writing code is a sin, but dumping code down the
drain is just about the most honorable thing a man can do.
</p>

<p>
I will reiterate a little. But see, Emacs has <i>0</i> structural
awareness.
</p>

<p>
And, so, all its packages and features only do 50% of what a user
might want, and they are mostly pretty bad at that too.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mediocre experience has become the norm.</i>
</p>

<p>
Emacs is good neither at specialization nor at embedding nor at
integration.  For instance, you can't make a buffer where different
regions have various modes. There are hacks for it, but they suck ass.
</p>

<p>
All the Emacs tools only let you <i>get by</i>, they aren't reaching up to
any stars in the sky.
</p>

<p>
And if you can't specialize, you will be inefficient and clumsy
forever.
</p>

<p>
There isn't a point where things get radically better for Emacs.  Can
you imagine to be building <i>ever more crap</i> on top of it?
</p>

<p>
I know I can't.
</p>

<p>
I would rather have a few specialized tools that work 100% percent of
the time or at least can be improved to that limit.  (And these tools
have to be living within one system so they could integrate and
interoperate with each other.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2013; <i>&lt;Author Name&gt;, can Emacs become structural?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you have read the <a href="./the-power-of-structure.html">previous
article</a>, especially the <i>Rune</i> section, you already know that I see
<i>seamlessly-structural</i> editing as the superior way of working with
text.
</p>

<p>
Hypothetically, could Emacs adopt that way of thinking? Let's just
consider that for a second.
</p>

<p>
Well, first of all, the core would have to become Lispy. But that's
just a prerequisite.
</p>

<p>
Then, some real expansion of what a <i>buffer</i> means and is capable of
doing would have to ensue.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it would be like trying to turn a freight train into a
helicopter with an assumption that, in the end, all the rails would
have to still be attached to the wheels.
</p>

<p>
And you get a homogeneity problem, this one worse than the "language
rewrite" one.
</p>

<p>
Although, in principle, I don't see why this couldn't be done
backwards-compatibly.  But, in practice, it would be much easier <del>to
just say that structural editing isn't worth it</del> to start from
scratch.
</p>

<p>
And that's without even thinking about any kind of an overarching GUI
toolkit, or a nice prototype system.
</p>

<p>
And even if the core were to accommodate a fraction of the
capabilities<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>, the whole rest of packages and code
don't just automagically upgrade. But they do become <i>morally
deprecated</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, it's bye-bye Emacs either way.
</p>

<p>
There is a foundational lack of flexibility in the foundations. And
it's not just about C (that's not even the tenth of it). It's the
defaults, the global state, the whole string-based model.
</p>

<p>
And that model is <i>fucked</i>.
</p>

<p>
I think, the one thing I don't like about Emacs core is that it is
majorly API-driven.  I think really powerful cores don't give you an
API, they give you building blocks.
</p>

<p>
The only building block in Emacs is a buffer, and that one is
basically a tape-driven Turing machine on steroids packaged for
personal computing.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
I am not really blaming or dismissing Emacs. It's an impressive piece
of technology.
</p>

<p>
But it's time for us to see that Emacs capabilities are bound by the
constant edge cases you have to work through.  In other words,
something will always be a little broken, a tad out of tune,
etc. etc. and none of it is really about not being good enough. It's
about the stuff underneath that's not good enough. The foundation
guarantees you will have constant stream of inefficiencies and
problems <i>at all times</i>.
</p>

<p>
Not even to mention that due to the limitations of structurelessness,
a lot of features will never be attempted <i>or even thought about</i>.
</p>

<p>
What do we want instead? Composition of objects. Embeddable
structures. Programmatic access to everything at the level <i>of what it
is, and not just how it is represented</i>. And that's where you need to
start to build your editor from: from the innate structure of any
given object. Treating things as objects which have a textual
interface! A specialized editor for each structure, many such editors
interoperating and <i>consisting</i> of other editors. That would yield
both better interfaces, AND more control, AND it will eliminate the
bloat, AND it will be fast. And, at last: it will be
<i>simpler</i>. Because that's what flexibility coupled with structure
gives you: power. And power can make complex things <i>simple</i>.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has hit its ceiling in terms of how powerful its interfaces can
be.
</p>

<p>
And then there's the issue of performance.
</p>

<p>
Editing this site's HTML reminded me of the true molasses-like
horrors.  Except, of course, molasses, while being slow, is at least
continuous and smooth. Emacs - not so much, <i>ha ha</i>.
</p>

<p>
Let me give you one last example before I finish.
</p>

<p>
Emacs highlights code on the fly &#x2013; stuff appears within the window
rectangle, and it figures out what it has to do with it.  So take a
look at the <a href="https://github.com/ahungry/fast-scroll">fast-scroll</a>
package. What does it do to make scrolling fast? Well, <i>it turns off
syntax highlighting while you are scrolling.</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a perfect example why Emacs has persisted for so long - when
things get tough, it lets you slog your way through just another
day. And that's a big part of the reason why they call it a <a
href=./img/editor-learning-curves.jpg>rabbit hole - because no
solution here ever works anywhere close to 100%.
</p>

<p>
But there's <i>nothing</i> that tells you that you have to stop.
</p>

<p>
And then, most times, you are forced to cache what you parse if you
want any kind of speed.
</p>

<p>
Caching means complexity.
</p>

<p>
Parsing means complexity.
</p>

<p>
Complexity means bugs and slow development.
</p>

<p>
Complexity means lack of clarity and a chronic inability to make stuff
<i>just work</i>.
</p>

<p>
That's not the programmer's fault. No, it's the fault of the system he
has to deal with.  And it's just bad: the performance, the lack of
structure. The chase for quality, elusive and everfading.
</p>

<p>
And then it all rains down on the user's head, and all he knows is to
"push through". That's what power users do.
</p>

<p>
The whole situation is bad bad bad and you don't need any further
convincing from me.
</p>

<p>
And you know what else? I think powerful programs like Emacs aren't
even meant for power users. Maybe they are meant for them to be
entertaining God.
</p>

<p>
And, I wager, if that's so, then God must have been bored out of his
mind.
</p>

<p>
And I think we are now seeing the fading trail of Emacs'
trailblazing. And we have been seeing it for many years.
</p>

<p>
People are fucking afraid to bury things for good.  They will keep
carrying it, a cart full of bullshit, legacy, pain.  Throwing things
away is the most relief a human gets, scalewise, and yet; some of the
most pivotal of your own memories, oh dear anon, involve ditching
something you once thought were too valuable.
</p>

<p>
The Emacs myopia.
</p>

<p>
You know it, you have seen it.  That's why they call it an OS, its
adepts octopi.  Emacs is like an eyepiece that lets you see, but turns
everything to shit.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is powerful, but only to a point of crudeness.  It's not quite
the Lisp machine that you thought it were.  Too limited for the modern
world, it's nearing the point of bare inertia.  Smoldering at its
core, a landfill in practical terms.
</p>

<p>
Accept it, believe it, because it's the truth.
