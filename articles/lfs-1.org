#+TITLE: LFS Project #01 -- 1. Preparation
* Introduction
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is an open-source project that has been
available since 1999, providing a comprehensive guide for constructing
a custom Linux operating system from the ground up. In this series of
blog posts, we will explain the process of building an LFS system on a
x86_64 architecture QEMU virtual machine.  We will present the
essential components, installation procedures, and configuration steps
in a clear and concise manner. These posts are intended for advanced
users who seek to customize their Linux system or gain a better
understanding of its components. By the end of following the steps
outlined in this post, readers will have a fully functional LFS system
that they have built from scratch.
