#+TITLE: Why Use Emacs When, You Know, VSCode with Vim Keys Exists
#+DATE: <2022-11-28 Mon>
* Preface
According to the 2022 Developer Survey by Stackoverflow, VSCode is the
most popular IDE for developers with a ratio of 74.48% in 71,010
responses, while Emacs is at 4.51%. This figure is convincing from my
point of view, as many of my colleagues and friends use VSCode daily
and love the tool for its convenience, powerfulness and
`just-werks'. Indeed, VSCode is good and has been recieving lots and
lots of effort from developers all over the world to make it better
(under Microsoft's supervision of course). And if you already obtain
Vim keybindings as your own muscle memory, the combination of a modern
and extensible IDE and a highly productive editing style would give
you (might be) the best coding workflow ever.

Then why should you use Emacs?
* What is Emacs
According to [[https://emacs.sexy][Emacs is Sexy]], Emacs is a highly extensible text
editor. It is built on a C core and provides a fully featured Lisp
environment. Emacs is strongly competent for all things that are
related to text manipulation. It comes with a fully capable GUI
interface, so it's also good at text presentation. Most importantly,
it is Free Software, you are free to run, copy, study, distribute,
change & improve it under the GNU General Public License. It has a
vibrant community, with lots of people sharing their experience, their
workflow, and their code to make Emacs more and more powerful.

For those that are unfamiliar with these words, here's a more
down-to-earth translation:

Any thing that has to do with texts, whether displaying it or editing
it, Emacs could do it the way you want it to.

If not, you could easily improve it to make it able to, freely. You
truly own it.

These descriptions seem light but few software utilities have reached
this level. Emacs is one of them.
* Free as in Freedom

Emacs is free software, the `free' means `Freedom' instead of `free
beer'.This means that not only can it be downloaded and used for free,
but users are also free to modify and distribute the software as they
see fit. The concept of freedom in software refers to users having the
ability to study, change, and distribute the software according to
their own needs and preferences. This is in contrast to proprietary
software, where the user is limited in their ability to modify or
distribute the software.

The freedom that comes with using Emacs is one of the key reasons why
it has remained a popular and widely-used text editor for over three
decades and why a large and active community has developed around
Emacs. This community contributes new features, bug fixes, and
packages to enhance the functionality of the software. This
has been instrumental in making Emacs one of the
most flexible and customizable text editors available.

The existence of a vibrant community also ensures that the software
continues to evolve and improve over time. People come and share their
experiences, workflow and configuration, so that other people could
learn and collaborate.This leads to a self-sustaining cycle of growth
and improvement, where everyone benefits from the collective knowledge
and expertise of the community.

The community's passion and commitment to the software ensures that it
will continue to be developed and improved for many years to
come. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, there is
always something new to learn from the community and a way to
contribute and give back.

Open-source products might be `[[https://atom.io][sunsetted]]', commercial corporations
might lose interest, Emacs will always be here, and we can expect it to continue to be a
valuable tool for many generations to come.

* Sharpen Your Axe

    four sharpening the axe.”

Polishing your tools is always a smart move.

Hackers are known for their laziness, but they're actually just highly
efficient. They want to streamline their work processes so they can
have more free time to continue being productive. By continually
looking for ways to optimize their workflow and increase efficiency,
they can make the most of their time and resources.

If you're faced with a six-hour task, a hacker would aim to complete
it in just two hours, then use the remaining time to figure out how to
do it even faster and better next time. This drive for optimization
and efficiency is a fundamental part of the hacker mentality, and it's
not just beneficial for individuals. It drives technological
advancements and fuels innovation in the tech world.

We're surrounded by powerful tools for automation, and the methods and
philosophy for optimizing workflows have never been better. It's a
great time to take advantage of these tools on a personal level, and
one tool you should definitely consider is Emacs.

Some people may be intimidated by their first experience with Emacs,
with its unconventional keybindings and 1990s-style GUI. But don't let
that stop you. Before uninstalling the program and leaving a negative
review, give it a chance.

Think of Vanilla Emacs as a rod made of top-quality steel. You can
still accomplish a lot with just the basics, but many users prefer a
more versatile, all-in-one tool. You can buy tools made by others,
hire someone to make them for you, or learn the craft and modify your
own tools as you go along. Whether you're a professional or a
hobbyist, the key is to learn how to customize your tools for better
results.

* Code Is Not All
Have you ever stopped to
think about all the different types of text you work with in a day?
Whether it's writing emails, reading articles, or even jotting down
notes, you likely spend a significant portion of your time working
with text. And when it comes to working with code, it's important to
have the right tools for the job.

Emacs is a Text Editor, like Vim. Just like Vim, it's designed to make
working with text as efficient and straightforward as possible. You
could easily make edits, search for specific information, and even
automate tasks with just a few keystrokes. And unlike some other text
editors, Emacs is easily customizable, so you can configure it to work
just the way you want it to.

It could be an IDE. If you're looking for a tool that can help you
write, test, and debug code, then Emacs could be an excellent
option. With its support for multiple programming languages, you could
easily use it as an integrated development environment (IDE) for all
your coding needs. And with its customizable interface, you can make
sure that the IDE works just the way you want it to.

It could be a front-end control panel for all the things you do on
your computer. With its support for plugins and scripts, you could use
Emacs to automate all sorts of tasks, from managing your to-do list to
organizing your files, making it easier to keep track of what you're working on and
switch between tasks.

In conclusion, the versatility and customization options of Emacs make
it a valuable tool for managing all types of text, not just code,
providing you with a more comprehensive text editor that can
streamline your workflow and simplify your daily tasks.
* Lisp
Have you ever heard the enduring joke about how Emacs is actually an
operating system, not just a text editor? Well, there's actually some
truth to that. You see, at its core, Emacs is a Lisp virtual machine,
or a Lisp VM for short.

Now, you may be thinking, what is a Lisp VM and why is it significant?
Well, the truth is that Lisp is a really good programming
language. It's been around for decades and has a long history of being
used for a variety of purposes, from scientific computing to
artificial intelligence. By incorporating a Lisp VM, Emacs gains the
power and flexibility of this versatile language, making it much more
than just a simple text editor.

So, the next time you hear the joke about how Emacs is an operating
system, remember that there's actually some truth to it. With its
built-in Lisp VM, it's much more than just a tool for editing text.

* All Your Thing Are Belong to Emacs

Emacs has gained a reputation for being a highly versatile and
flexible platform, and its users have a tendency to increasingly rely
on it for a wide range of computing needs. The reason for this is
rooted in the way that Emacs operates. Unlike many other platforms,
Emacs does not have a namespace for functions. This means that every
function is loaded in the same place, allowing for easy
intercommunication between different functions. This level of
interactivity across different programs is unmatched by even the UNIX
pipes, which were considered revolutionary in their own right. The
ability to share source code between different packages provides even
greater freedom and opens up an array of new possibilities for users.

Another primary advantage of using Emacs is the ability to hack
together a custom front-end for various tasks. Whether it's for
controlling external functions or for managing specific workflows, the
adaptability of Emacs makes it simple for users to craft their ideal
environment. And as users become more familiar with the platform, they
often find new and creative ways to extend its functionality.

Emacs is not just a text editor, it's an all-in-one computing solution
that can handle a wide range of tasks. From coding and debugging, to
writing notes and documentation, to managing to-do lists, chatting
with colleagues, reading RSS feeds and e-books, organizing files,
sending and receiving emails, and much more, Emacs is a comprehensive
tool that streamlines many of the tasks that computer users face on a
daily basis. The versatility and customization options offered by
Emacs make it a highly efficient and flexible platform for a variety
of workflows.
