* About This Site
This is the third revision so let's try to make this one stay longer.

Just like the preamble says, there is everything but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement][the one you thought]].

We don't do none of that here.

I've realized more deeply that all of the things I've wrote
are basically worthless noises. So I deleted all those
``articles'' trying to start this all over again. (You can still get
some of them from Internet Archive and all of them from the git repo.)

This site contains some of my thoughts and notes about various topics
and fields which I was exposed to loosely in that time period.

I like taking notes. Emacs handles it really well.[fn::[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRpHIa-2XCE][This mysterious
youtuber thinks of that too.]]] Everything sucks but Emacs sucks less,
that's why I'd consider it to be the greatest piece of software mankind
has to offer. It is that much efficient and satisfying to write and
manage notes in Emacs (while also doing most of other things in Emacs),
I don't know what those kids like to use these days, but their fancy
apps tend to not look as attractive as Emacs.

Another reason to why I like taking notes is that I tend to forget
things, be it what I had for lunch yesterday or methods to prove a
scheme to be CPA-secure. It takes so much time and effort to practice
and internalize knowledge, and I don't have enough time to /deliberately
practice/[fn::Do you kids still remember this meme?] all the knowledge I
encounter everyday and hope that I will face a situation some day in
which my expertise might be greatly appreciated.

So I just stick to writing things down for the future me to pick up
quickly, and make sure I could search and get to some random part of
some random note in a negligible amount of time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Leave the internalization to the time and those obstacles I'll face./
#+END_QUOTE

That's what this site is about. Thoughts and notes. Have fun reading and
feel free to correct any factual or grammar errors or typos via the
method described in the postamble.
